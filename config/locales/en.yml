    title: Patients' Rights
    body: ! 'The legal basis for health care in Ukraine is the law entitled, “The Basic Law on Health in Ukraine,” which declares and protects a right to health for every Ukrainian. It defines “health care” as “a set of specialized measures that promote better health, improve sanitary culture, prevent disease and disabilities, diagnose ailments early, helps people with chronic and acute diseases, and rehabilitates the sick and disabled.” The law defines the principles of public health in Ukraine and lists the rights and responsibilities of the government and citizens in the healthcare sphere. Among citizens'' responsibilities is the duty to take care of one''s own health.


      The list of rights specified by law are as follows:


      1) The right to safe and healthy conditions for work, study, life, and recreation;

      2) The right to qualified medical care, including the right to choose one''s doctor, course of treatment, and healthcare institution;

      3) The right to accurate and timely information on the state of personal and public health, including existing and possible risk factors;

      4) The right to participate in the management and implementation of healthcare and conduct community examinations;

      5) The right to protection against any form of illegal discrimination connected with health;

      6) The right to compensation for damages to one''s health;

      7) The right for workers to appeal unlawful decisions and actions of employees of healthcare institutions;

      8) The right to conduct independent medical examinations in the case of a disagreement with the conclusions of a government medical examination, an incident of compulsory treatment, or other cases where the activities of healthcare professionals might infringe upon human rights;

      9) The right of access to patients in inpatient facilities to family members, legal guardians, trustees, notaries, lawyers, other healthcare professionals, and priests for sermons and other religious ceremonies.


      With regard to liability for the violation of human rights in the health sector, the current legislation of Ukraine defines criminal, property and administrative responsibilities as determined by the norms of the Criminal and Civil Codes and the Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offenses, respectively.
