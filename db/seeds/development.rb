I was really surprised that he wasn't going to force me to pay him money that I don't have. The operation he performed on my leg was quick and painless, and I was back at work in less than a week. I cannot express my gratitude enough to Doctor Savchenko and his team. I am very thankful that we have such good doctors in Ukraine.",
