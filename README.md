Aybolit: Promoting Ethical Doctors in Ukraine
=======

Aybolit is a online platform for identifying and promoting ethical behavior in the Ukrainian public health care system. Patients submit stories of experiences with their doctor that meet a specific ethical standard. Those stories are collected, commented on by the patient’s peers, and then distributed back to health-care providers and their management.

This project seeks to engage the Ukrainian public on what is an acceptable ethical standard by which to hold health care providers, and ultimately aims to shift the perception of what financial relationship is and is not acceptable and normal between patients and doctors in Ukraine.
